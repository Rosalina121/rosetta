# Rosetta - Turn your Osu! song library into a Beat Saber one.

Use: 
- Change `songs_dir` to your Osu! songs direcotry.
- Change `save_path` to your Beat Saber songs direcotry.
- Set `count` to your desired number

Features:
- Uses standard Beat Saber folder naming scheme
- You can choose up to 10 Beatsaver listings per provided Osu! song
- Automatically goes to another osng after installation or not finding any candidates
- Shows song similarity (`kinda match`, `likely match` and `same name`)

Upcoming:
- More conviniet way for specifying paths
- GUI?
- Maybe auto path? Since most users install games in default folders.
- Create Beast Saber playlist made of downloaded songs
